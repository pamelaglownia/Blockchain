### Description ###

Simple blockchain project using multithreading.

Project's tasks come from JetBrains Academy.

### Features ###

1. Creating blockchain in several threads.
2. Each block has information about previous block hash (only verified block can be connected to blockchain).
3. Hash difficulty is based on elapsed time to generate previous block.
4. Each block has a simulation of transaction.

The most valuable concepts of this project (for me) are:
- multithreading basis,
- cryptography basis.
